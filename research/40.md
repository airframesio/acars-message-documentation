Label 40 (UM40) messages are a user defined message type. They are uplinks from ground stations to the plane. According to the ICAO's Gold (Global Operational Data Link Document) 2nd edition and ICAO Doc 4444 it is a reserved message type.

They take the following forms atleast from my research and messages I've seen. 
    1. Free-text messages from the air traffic control or other ground stations to the flight crew.
    2. Requests for weather updates or other information
    3. Other operational or administrative messages

Some example messages for each message content
1. Free Text discussing altitude changes with ATC.
